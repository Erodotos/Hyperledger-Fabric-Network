## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

NOTE : The following instractions have been tested on an Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS Virtual Machine with 4 cores, 8GB RAM and 80GB secondary storage. 

### Prerequisites

We will need the followin to be installed in order to make Hyperledger Fabric work : 

* [Git] (https://github.com/Erodotos/Hyperledger-Fabric-Network/blob/master/README.md#install-git)
* [cURL]
* [Docker]
* [Docker Compose]
* [Go]
* [Node.js] 
* [NPM]
* [Python 2.7]
* [Hyperledger Fabric Binaries and Docker Images]

#### Install Git

#### Install cURL

#### Install Docker

#### Install Docker Compose

#### Install Go

#### Install Node.js

#### Install NPM

#### Install Python 2.7

#### Install Hyperledger Fabric Binaries and Docker Images
```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
